# Building Backend with Spring Boot

## Spring Boot: The HERO of Spring Framework

- Spring Boot was introduced in April 2014 to reduce some of the burdens of configuring and setting up Spring applications.
- With Spring Boot, developers can create web applications and microservices within minutes, thanks to its convention-over-configuration approach.
- Spring Boot is now one of the most popular frameworks for building Java-based backend applications.
- Spring Boot is a mandatory skill for Java developers due to the latest trends like Full Stack Development, Microservices, Serverless Architecture, Containerization, etc.
- Spring Boot simplifies the development process by providing pre-configured templates and starter dependencies, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than boilerplate code.
- It also offers features like embedded servers (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty), which eliminate the need for deploying applications to external servers.
- Spring Boot's auto-configuration capabilities automatically set up the application based on the dependencies present in the classpath, further reducing the need for manual configuration.
- Additionally, Spring Boot provides production-ready features such as health checks, metrics, and monitoring, making it easier to manage and maintain applications in production environments.
- Overall, Spring Boot has revolutionized the way Java applications are built, making it faster, easier, and more efficient for developers to create robust backend systems.
