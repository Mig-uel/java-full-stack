# Java Full-Stack Developer with React & Spring Boot

## Evolution of Web Apps

- Static websites of the early 1990s used simple HTML and CSS.
- Dynamic websites came in during the early 2000s that used HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, ASP.NET, JSP, and databases like MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.
- By the mid-2000s, something revolutionary happened with the introduction of AJAX, which allowed asynchronous data loading without refreshing the entire page.
- Fast-forward to the 2010s, we saw the rise of Single Page Applications (SPAs) using frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue.js on the front end, with RESTful APIs on the back end.
- Today, we have advanced front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, paired with robust back-end technologies like Spring Boot, Node.js, and Django, often utilizing microservices architecture.
